# Implementation Flow for Authentication Features

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation flow for the authentication features of the Python authentication application. It includes the steps for user sign up and sign in, backend data validation, storage, and frontend integration.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Project Setup
- Create a new Python project directory structure as outlined in the project tree.
- Set up a virtual environment and install the required dependencies listed in `backend/requirements.txt`.

### 2. Backend Development
#### 2.1 Database Configuration
- In `backend/database.py`, configure the database connection using SQLAlchemy.
- Define the User model in `backend/models.py` with fields for `id`, `email`, and `hashed_password`.

#### 2.2 API Routes
- Implement sign up and sign in routes in `backend/routes.py`.
  - **Sign Up Route**: 
    - Accepts user input (email and password).
    - Validates input using schemas defined in `backend/schemas.py`.
    - Hashes the password and stores the user in the database.
  - **Sign In Route**: 
    - Accepts user input (email and password).
    - Validates input and checks the hashed password against the stored password.

#### 2.3 Data Validation
- Use Pydantic or Marshmallow in `backend/schemas.py` to define validation schemas for user input.
- Ensure that email format is valid and password meets security criteria.

### 3. Frontend Development
#### 3.1 HTML Templates
- Create `frontend/templates/login.html` and `frontend/templates/register.html` for user interfaces.
  - Include form fields for email and password, and a submit button.

#### 3.2 Form Handling
- In `frontend/app.py`, handle form submissions for login and registration.
- Use Flask to render templates and process form data.

### 4. API Documentation
- Document the API endpoints in `docs/swagger.yaml` using Swagger format.
  - Include details for request and response formats for both sign up and sign in.

### 5. Testing
- Write unit tests in `tests/test_auth.py` to test the authentication features.
- Write tests in `tests/test_validation.py` to ensure data validation works as expected.

### 6. Running the Application
- Provide instructions in `README.md` on how to run the application, including setting up the environment, starting the server, and accessing the frontend.

### 7. Conclusion
This implementation flow provides a comprehensive guide to developing authentication features in the Python application, ensuring a secure and user-friendly experience.
